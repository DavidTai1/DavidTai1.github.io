#### I am a recent college graduate (bachelor of Computer Science) from University Of Waterloo.
#### While working on academic and extracurricular projects, I developed proven teamwork, fast learning and problem-solving skills, which I hope to leverage into the developer role at any company.

#### I also learned swift 3 myself and is building an ios app on my own.
